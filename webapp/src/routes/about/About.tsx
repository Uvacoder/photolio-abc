        <h3>Hey ðŸ‘‹</h3>
        <p>
          Thank you for being interested in my work! My name is Ringo (but I'm
          also known as zekro) and I'm {AGE} old. I'm actually working as a
          full-stack developer in germany, but in the middle of 2021, I
          discovered photography as another passion of mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Years before, I was working a lot on digital design and web video
          production. I created personal web designs for friends of mine (feel
          free to discover some of them on my{' '}
          <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/zekrotja" target="_blank">
            DeviantArt profile
          </a>
          ). Also, all graphical designs for my{' '}
          <a href="https://youtube.com/zekrommaster110">YouTube channel</a> are
          completely self-made.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, I primarily focus on expressing myself, my feelings and my
          perspectives in photography and photo editing. As you can see in my
          Work, I'm mainly interested in street photography but I am really
          excited to discover and getting into more topics like portrait, car,
          architecture and wildlife photography in the future.
